# models

The `@b4h/models` library provides a set of TypeScript interfaces and models for the Budget4Home project. These models are designed to represent the core entities within the application, such as groups, expenses, labels, and users. By using these models, you can ensure type safety and consistency across your codebase when working with budget4home-related data.
